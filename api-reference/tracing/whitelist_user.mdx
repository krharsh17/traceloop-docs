By default, Traceloop logs all prompts and responses created by your users. You can disable this behaviour by following [this guide](/openllmetry/privacy/traces). 

This endpoint allows you to selectively enable this behaviour for some of your users, using their association proprties such as their user IDs.

## Request Body

<ParamField body="associationPropertyAllowList" type="Associated Property Object">
The list of association properties (like `{userId: "123"}`) that will be used to determine which users' data is to be logged.
</ParamField>

Example:

```json
{
  "associationPropertyAllowList": [
    {
      "userId": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```
